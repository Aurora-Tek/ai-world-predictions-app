# Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Prediction Framework

Welcome to our **open-source, real-time prediction and arbitrage project**! This framework orchestrates **multiple specialized agents** (RL-based, LLM-based, heuristic, etc.), each ingesting **live data** (market odds, social media sentiment, weather feeds, etc.) to **place bets or forecasts** in an **internal exchange**. Over time, the **Evolution Manager** clones the top performers, fires the weakest, and introduces small **mutations**, ensuring continuous improvement and **emergent behaviors**.

## 1. Project Overview
We aim to build a **self-evolving, multi-agent system** that thrives on **real-time data**—whether it’s from sports betting APIs, financial markets, social media sentiment, or even natural disaster sensors. Each agent uses specialized strategies, placing predictions or bets in a shared “betting floor” (exchange). A **scoreboard** ranks agents based on profit, accuracy, or other metrics, and the **Evolution Manager** fosters a Darwinian environment by **cloning top performers** with slight changes and **removing underperformers**.

### Key Components

- **Data Ingestion**: Streams or polls data (sports, finance, sentiment).
- **Vector DB (RAG)**: Stores embeddings and metadata for quick retrieval.
- **Multi-Agent Exchange**: Central environment where each agent “makes trades” or predictions.
- **Scoreboard & Evolution**: Periodically culls losers, clones winners, and mutates them.
- **UI or CLI**: Observe real-time agent performance and emergent behaviors.

## 2. Key Features & Goals

### Multi-Agent Collaboration & Competition
- Agents adopt unique strategies (RL-based, time-series, LLM-based, etc.).
- Agents may “collaborate” indirectly by pulling from the same data, but effectively they **compete** for top performance.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Agents can query a vector store (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) for the latest sentiment or historical data.
- Great for LLM-based agents that need context.

### Mixture-of-Experts
- Each agent can be specialized; a **meta-learner** (optionally) can combine their insights.
- Improves robustness and accuracy by leveraging diverse “expert” strategies.

### Evolution & Self-Improvement
- Top agents get **forked** (cloned), with small hyperparameter or prompt changes.
- Bottom agents get “fired” or replaced.
- Over multiple “generations,” the system discovers profitable strategies in real time.

### Real-Time Adaptation
- Ideal for domains with **fast-moving data** (live sports, high-frequency trading).
- Reacts to **shocks** or breaking news (e.g., star player injury) within seconds or minutes.

#### Project Goal
- Provide an **impressive demonstration** of cutting-edge AI architecture.
- **Open-source** the code so the community can adapt it for sports betting, philanthropic hedge funds, climate predictions, or health policy.

## 3. Why Predictions Matter

### Arbitrage & Profit
- If you consistently predict outcomes before markets fully adjust, you can **profit** in sports betting, trading, or other speculations.
- Example: Quickly detect negative social sentiment about a team’s star player. The model places a bet on the opposing team before the odds shift.

### Disaster Forecasting & Public Good
- Agents can model **hurricanes, floods, or disease spread**, providing better resource allocation or early warnings.
- Continual evolution ensures the system stays current with new data or changes in climate patterns.

### Reducing Uncertainty
- By fusing **real-time sentiment**, **market data**, and other signals, the system yields **more accurate, dynamic forecasts**—helping people and organizations make data-driven decisions.

## 4. Core Architecture

Below is a high-level breakdown of the main modules:

1. **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**
   - Pulls real-time data (sports, finance, social media).
   - Cleans, classifies sentiment (DistilBERT/Hugging Face or OpenAI model).
   - Generates embeddings → stored in a vector DB.

2. **Vector Store (RAG)**
   - Houses embeddings + metadata.
   - Agents (especially LLM-based) query relevant context quickly.

3. **Multi-Agent Exchange**
   - Agents "place bets" or "make predictions."
   - Tracks outcomes, updates agent balances or scoring metrics.
   - Example call: `place_bet(agent_id, market_key, predicted_outcome, stake)`

4. **Scoreboard & Evolution Manager**
   - Scoreboard ranks agents by profit, accuracy, or ROI.
   - Evolution manager "forks" top agents, "fires" bottom.
   - Introduces random or controlled hyperparam mutations.

5. **Dashboard / CLI**
   - Real-time or iterative logs.
   - Leaderboard display.
   - Historical bet overview, emergent strategy detection.

### Multi-Agent Loop
1. **Ingest new data** (sport event, price feed, sentiment).
2. **Agents** gather context from the vector store, decide on an action (bet on Team A or trade a certain stock).
3. **Exchange** logs the bet, tracks the outcome.
4. After a certain period or event resolution, **Scoreboard** updates.
5. **Evolution** fires the worst agents, clones the best, repeating indefinitely.

## 5. Intended Use Cases & Benefits

### Sports Betting
- Real-time ingestion of sports news + social media.
- Agents rapidly respond to injuries, momentum shifts, or sentiment changes.

### Financial Market Trading
- Agents monitor real-time feeds on stocks, crypto, or currency pairs.
- If sentiment or fundamental data shifts, an agent can place trades **ahead** of the general market.

### Natural Disaster Forecasting
- Agents “bet” on the severity or path of a storm, each using different data feeds (satellite, IoT sensors).
- The best approach emerges quickly, potentially **saving lives**.

### Philanthropic Hedge Fund
- Use the system to generate alpha, direct a portion of profits to **climate solutions**, healthcare, or educational programs.

## 6. Future Extensions & Doing Good

### Advanced Agent Types
- **RL** with policy gradient or Q-learning for dynamic learning.
- **LLM-based** for deeper text analysis of news articles, fine-tuned on domain data.

### Multi-Modal Inputs
- Ingest images (e.g., satellite, weather radar).
- Combine textual and visual data for more robust predictions.

### Federated Learning
- Different organizations can train specialized agents without sharing raw data.

### Auto-Fine-Tuning Pipeline
- Automatic partial fine-tuning of LLM-based agents after each generation to incorporate new examples.

### Public Good
- **Disaster mitigation**: Early warnings, resource planning.
- **Public health**: Monitor disease outbreak patterns and forecast.
- **Environmental**: Carbon credit pricing, reforestation project ROI modeling.
