However, NASA had already initiated plans months earlier for SpaceX to return astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore as part of its Crew-9 mission due to concerns with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which experienced technical failures. The situation was portrayed as if the astronauts were stranded, but NASA clarified they were never without an option to return as they were always included in routine rotation plans. The decision to use SpaceX was partly due to safety concerns informed by past experiences with space shuttle disasters. Despite the social media controversy, NASA confirmed that both the astronauts and SpaceX were aligned on the mission timeline and Crew-9 would bring them back safely.",

While China's emissions are the largest globally, their renewable energy expansion positions them to lead in global climate initiatives. Despite challenges in achieving net-zero targets, China continues to export significant amounts of renewable technology under the Belt and Road Initiative, deploying 24 gigawatts of capacity overseas in 2024 alone.",
