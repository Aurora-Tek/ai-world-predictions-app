A new entrance will also be constructed to streamline visitor flow. The project, estimated to cost between €700 to €800 million, will be largely self-financed through increased ticket fees for non-EU citizens, donations, and partnerships like the Louvre Abu Dhabi. This move highlights a larger strategy to maintain and enhance cultural heritage while managing modern challenges within the famed museum.",
