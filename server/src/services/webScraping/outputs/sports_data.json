Patrick Mahomes addressed the frequent jokes about his voice, likened to Kermit the Frog, and spoke about his experiences with such comments growing up.

The upcoming Super Bowl will occur at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The article also reflects on the Chiefs' consistent performance, reaching five Super Bowls in six years.
