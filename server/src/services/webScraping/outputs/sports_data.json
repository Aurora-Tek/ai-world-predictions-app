Brittany shared an Instagram post referencing an incident where Bills fans displayed a Kermit the Frog toy in a noose wearing a Chiefs jersey during a previous game between the teams, which she found disturbing. Patrick Mahomes addressed the frequent jokes about his voice, likened to Kermit the Frog, and spoke about his experiences with such comments growing up. The Chiefs' victory set up another Super Bowl appearance against the Philadelphia Eagles, whom they beat in the 2023 Super Bowl. The upcoming Super Bowl will occur at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. The article also reflects on the Chiefs' consistent performance, reaching five Super Bowls in six years. It discusses the broader debate over whether NFL games favor popular teams like the Chiefs and includes contrasting views from personalities like Dave Portnoy, who criticized the refereeing in the Chiefs-Bills game.",
